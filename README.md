# Data-Processing-and-Storage-Assignment  
An in-memory database with transaction support  

## Setup Instructions  
To set up this project, you will need:  

- Python 3.8 or higher ➡️ [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) ➡️ [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  



## Running the Program  
1. Open the `transactions.py` file in VS Code.  
2. Open a terminal in VS Code and run the program with:  
   ```bash  
   python transactions.py  
   ```  


## Assignment Suggestions  

The provided example in the instructions should use consistent variable naming and incorporate edge cases to what the expected behaviors are. I think including a  starter template with commented sections for each method would make the assignment a little more approachable while still achieving the same goals. Lastly, and this goes for more of the assignments, not just this one, clear grading instructions on what can potentially get points off. Often times, I’d get like .25 - 1 point off for stuff that was never mentioned in the rubric.
